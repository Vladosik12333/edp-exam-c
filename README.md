## Create a system similar to student-embassy but that should allow to enroll to university
1. There should be a Student and University class.
2. Create events:
* parent class Event with payload.
* child events [think what kind of events might be there: eg. ApplicationSentEvent, ApplicationRejected etc. ]
3. Create communication queue
4. All classes could be in main.py
5. Demonstrate the usage in main.py
6. Commit the changes to this repository.
You need all git instructions in terminal:
``` 
git add main.py 
git commit -m 'Add class'
git push origin main
```
7. Send me the link to your repository
